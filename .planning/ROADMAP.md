# Roadmap: Intelligent Dead Reckoning System (IDR-INS)
*SIH Problem Statement ID: 26168 | ISRO*

## Overview
This roadmap takes the project from the raw problem statement and IO-VNBD dataset ingestion through baseline mathematical dead reckoning, deep-learning forward velocity prediction, robust coordinate frame alignment, offline map-matching with kinematic constraints, GNSS-INS Kalman fusion, and dual deployment (high-rate 200 Hz edge engine and 10 Hz mobile app). The ultimate deliverable is a verified navigation system achieving $< 10\%$ drift during GNSS blackouts, complete with trajectory comparison plots for the SIH proposal evaluation.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 1: Dataset Pipeline & Baseline INS Dead Reckoning** - Ingest IO-VNBD dataset, establish ground truth trajectory visualizer, and build baseline unassisted double-integration INS dead reckoning to measure raw drift.
- [ ] **Phase 2: In-Vehicle Alignment & Signal Preprocessing** - Implement automatic gravity-based pitch/roll leveling, forward yaw axis alignment, Butterworth vibration filtering, and ZUPT/ZARU zero-velocity detectors.
- [ ] **Phase 3: AI/ML Speed & Kinematic Estimation** - Build and train deep-learning models (1D CNN/GRU/TCN) to estimate vehicle forward speed from windowed IMU vibrations without OBD-II feeds, and export to ONNX.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Non-Holonomic Constraints & Offline Map-Matching** - Implement Non-Holonomic Constraints (NHC) and an offline road-snapping / HMM map matcher using OpenStreetMap road link geometries.
- [ ] **Phase 5: GNSS+INS Fusion & Instant Blackout Handler** - Build Extended/Unscented Kalman Filter fusing GNSS + IMU with sub-50ms outage transition to AI-Dead Reckoning and smooth reconvergence upon GNSS recovery.
- [ ] **Phase 6: High-Frequency Edge Core Engine** - Package the complete IDR-INS core into an edge-deployable modular engine supporting up to 200 Hz for high-grade/FOG external IMUs.
- [ ] **Phase 7: Mobile Navigation Application** - Develop a cross-platform mobile navigation client (10 Hz) featuring offline map rendering, smooth vehicle tracking cursor, and real-time navigation status indicators.
- [ ] **Phase 8: SIH Benchmark Deliverables** - Generate quantitative benchmark metrics, trajectory plots (Ground Truth vs Raw vs IDR), and proposal artifacts demonstrating $<10\%$ drift for SIH screening.
